# SwiftUI-ComplexGesture-MiniProject-Restart
The main goal of this mini project is to inspire us on what we can accomplish with the SwiftUI framework.


COMPLEX SWIFTUI GESTURES
We will create such a custom button with complex gestures that we can not find in Appleâ€™s stock user interface library.

PARALLAX EFFECT
By using multiple movements in the opposite direction (parallax effect) we can add depth to this amazing onboarding screen.

Samples are from Udemy Courses, Youtube etc.
